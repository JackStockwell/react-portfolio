## Description

My portfolio made with React. As I approach the end of my studies I now need to start thinking more about my future career which requires a portfolio to display my works. That is why I created my portfolio, to not only use React and learn in an active setting but also create something that will have meaning moving forward.

My previous portfolio was made 5 months ago, I have learned a great deal in 5 months so it is dated, feels clunky and not greatly responsive. With my new found knowledge of React it was the perfect opportunity to show off everything I have learned. I learned a great about React and how it works and functions and the wide array of components available and which I would like to implement in time.

While it nothing about this project stands out against the vast array of portfolio's out there I am exceptionally proud of the colour scheme and how it all came together in the end.

There's plenty to more add, to give it more razz especially on the Skills section and potential blog for myself.
